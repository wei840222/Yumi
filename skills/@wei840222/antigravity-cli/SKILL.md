# Antigravity CLI

Use this skill for Google Antigravity CLI, whose binary is `agy`. Do not call it `antigravity` in commands.

## Default workflow

1. Determine whether the user needs non-interactive automation, interactive TUI help, configuration, artifact review, plugin work, or migration.
2. Prefer `agy --print` for scriptable one-shot tasks and `agy` / `agy --prompt-interactive` for live TUI workflows.
3. Check the local binary before giving command-specific guidance when possible:
   ```bash
   agy --help
   agy version
   ```
4. For risky work, keep sandboxing and permission prompts enabled. Do not suggest `--dangerously-skip-permissions` unless the user explicitly wants that risk and the workspace is trusted.
5. When changing settings, prefer the TUI `/config`, `/permissions`, `/model`, `/keybindings`, or `/mcp` commands. Edit JSON files directly only when the TUI path is unavailable or the user asks for file-level changes.

## Gotchas

- `--prompt` is an alias for `--print`; it does not keep the session interactive.
- `--model` is supported on CLI for session model selection, and models can also be selected inside the TUI with `/model` or listed via `agy models`.
- `agy --continue` resumes the most recent conversation; use `agy --conversation <id>` for a specific session.
- Plugin management is under `agy plugin ...`; local Agent Skills live separately in skill paths.
- Artifact review is interactive; for headless automation, design prompts to ask for patch summaries or command output instead of relying on the review panel.
